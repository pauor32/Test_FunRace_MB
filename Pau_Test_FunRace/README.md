// Time:
The whole exercise took about 4 hours to complete, including the time spent analyzing the game and the core 	elements.

// Difficult Parts:
The most difficult part was to make a smooth, accelerated movement through a path, specially when applying 		curves and rotations.

// Parts to improve:
An obvious part to improve is the characters and camera rotation, with enough time, I would like to polish 	that aspect of the game since it creates a bit of an annoying sensation to the player.
	
I would do that by refining the rotation algorithm to have a smoother rotation alongside the path. Another 		option could be to create an algorithm that computes the path's rotation an apply that to the character.

After solving that, if I went further into the game development, I would create some new obstacles to add to 	the level design and polish the game feeling with animations or particles. 
I would also tackle the special movement parts of the original game like the zipline or the hand 		stairs, which seem a combination of trigger volume zones and animations.  

// Conclusion:
Of this exercise I think it was pretty doable, however, it took me more time that I had anticipated, leaving some parts not as polished as I would have liked.

On the other hand, I think with enough time and effort I could finish something pretty similar to the original experience.
